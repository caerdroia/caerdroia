❓ Does this come from some alien civilisation 90 million light years away from Earth or maybe it's a coded message for Napoleaon with directions to escape [Elba](https://www.history.com/news/elba-exile-napoleon-escape)?"❓

I'm Denis and welcome to my GitHub page! 
I'm an aspiring Software Engineer (started diving into Java during covid, who can I surprise with that fact?) and a Marketing Professional (real estate development). I'm passionate about many things (who isn't?) but if I had to choose just 6, these are the ones which came to mind first:


1️⃣ 🔭 Solving various problems with elegant solutions (Math is the Ultimate Beauty and that's why I find [Max Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesis" mind-bending)"; 
2️⃣ 💻 All things digital (engadget.com, theverge.com are among my most frequently used bookmarks);
3️⃣"🚀Physics - esp. foundations of QM  (an avid reader of popular science books and a listener of science podcasts - Sean Carroll's ["Mindscape"](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/) being the favorite);
4️⃣ 🎥Movies (notably comedy, sci-fi and [giallo horror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giallo)). I love humor and 😆 standup comedy, among my favorite comedians are: 
  ➡️ [Louis CK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wali_4tdQ-g) is #1 for me;
  ➡️[George Carlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy-sVByUHqE) (dark genius!);
  ➡️[Bill Burr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3g64swMf1M&t=354s) (his voice acting is phenomenal);
  ➡️[Dave Chappelle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2Rw3HspWY0) - all his specials are top-notch!;
  ➡️[Ricky Gervais]<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaAVp54twDA&t=280s> (for that dry-wit British humor).
5️⃣📸 photograpy (landscape and B&W portraits) and my friends always told me I should do it professionally (should one ever listen to his friends on what to do in life?);
6️⃣🐕 dogs (I have an adorable english cream dachshund named Ash).

BTW Here's the picture of him taking a snow bath btw.
