❓ <em>Does this come from some alien civilisation 90 million light years away from Earth or maybe it's a coded message for Napoleaon with directions to escape Elba?"</em>❓

<p>I'm Denis and welcome to my GitHub page! 
I'm an aspiring Software Engineer (started diving into Java during covid, who can I surprise with that fact?) and a Marketing Professional (real estate development). I'm passionate about many things (who isn't?) but if I had to choose just 6, these are the ones which came to mind first:</p>

<ol>
  <li>🔭 Solving various problems with elegant solutions (Math is the Ultimate Beauty and that's why I find Max Tegmark's [Mathematical Universe Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesis) mind-bending);</li>
<li>💻 All things digital (engadget.com, theverge.com are among my most frequently used bookmarks);</li>
<li>🚀Physics - esp. foundations of QM  (an avid reader of popular science books and a listener of science podcasts - Sean Carroll's ["Mindscape"](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/) being the favorite);</li>
<li>🎥Movies (notably comedy, sci-fi and [giallo horror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giallo)). I love humor and 😆 standup comedy, among my favorite comedians are: 
  <ul><li>[Louis CK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wali_4tdQ-g) is #1 for me;</li>
  <li>[George Carlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy-sVByUHqE) (dark genius!);</li> 
  <li>[Bill Burr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3g64swMf1M&t=354s) (his voice acting is phenomenal);</li> 
  <li>[Dave Chappelle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2Rw3HspWY0) - all his specials are top-notch!;</li> 
  <li>[Ricky Gervais]<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaAVp54twDA&t=280s> (for that dry-wit British humor).</li></ul>
<li>📸 photograpy (landscape and B&W portraits) and my friends always told me I should do it professionally (should one ever listen to his friends on what to do in life?);</li>
<li>🐕 dogs (I have an adorable english cream dachshund named Ash).<p>

<p>BTW Here's the picture of <strong>him taking a snow bath</strong> btw.</li>
</ol>
