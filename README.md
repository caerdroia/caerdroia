❓ *Does this come from some alien civilisation 90 million light years away from Earth or maybe it's a coded message for Napoleaon with directions to escape Elba?"*❓

I'm Denis and welcome to my GitHub page! I'm an aspiring Software Engineer (started diving into Java in fall of 2021) and a Marketing Professional (real estate development). I'm passionate about many things (who isn't?) if I had to choose (just did) these are the ones I'd share:

🔭 solving problems and finding elegant solutions (and I find Max Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis mind-bending);
💻 all things digital (engadget.com, theverge.com are among my most frequently used bookmarks);

🚀physics (an avid reader of popular science books and a listener of science podcasts - Sean Carroll's "Mindscape" being the favorite); 
🎥(notably comedy, sci-fi and giallo horror) and 😆 standup comedy -  Louis CK is #1 for me, but I also love Gearge Carlin (dark genius!), Bill Burr (his voice parody is something), Dave Chappelle (The Artist) and Ricky Gervais (English humor with a twist).
📸 photograpy (landscape and B&W portraits) and my friends always said I should do it professionally (should I believe them?);
🐕 dogs (I have an adorable english cream dachshund named Ash). 

right... 

* I could write another 3 pages here but hey, GitHub's all about my code and not me occupying precious bytes here ranting. lol

* In spare time I love to walk/hike for miles and miles - it's not important whether it's a city park, a forest or 1000 km Camino de Santiago. 
* Let's say walking is my way of practicing mindfulness and being at peace with myself and the world (heard Einstein was of the same opinion, have you?). 

* Here's the picture of my dog btw.
