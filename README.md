*Does it come from some alien civilisation living some 90 light years away from Earth or maybe it's a coded message for Napoleaon with directions to escape Elba?"

I'm Denis and welcome to my GitHub page! I'm an aspiring Software Engineer (started diving into Java in fall of 2021) and a Marketing Professional (real estate development). I'm passionate about many things (who isn't?) if I had to choose (just did) these are the ones I'd share:

* solving problems and finding elegant solutions (I find Mathematical Universe Hypothesis quite interesting);
* all things digital (engadget.com, theverge.com and the like are my daily sources of information);
* physics (an avid reader of popular science books and a dedicated listener of science podcasts - Sean Carroll's "Mindscape" being the favorite); 
* movies (notably comedy, sci-fi and giallo horror) and standup comedy -  Louis CK is #1 for me, but I also love Gearge Carlin (dark genius!), Bill Burr (his voice parody is something), Dave Chappelle (The Artist) and Ricky Gervais (English humor with a twist).
* photograpy (landscape and B&W portraits) and my friends always said I should do it professionally (should I believe them?);
* dogs (I have an adorable english cream dachshund named Ash). 

right... 

* I could write another 3 pages here but hey, GitHub's all about my code and not me occupying precious bytes here ranting . lol

* In spare time I love to walk/hike for miles and mile - it's not important whether it's a city park, a forest or 1000 km Camino de Santiago. 
* Let's say walking is my way of practicing mindfulness and being at peace with myself and the world (heard Einstein was of the same opinion, have you?).
